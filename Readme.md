# Unum - Proof of concept readme

This project was developed as part of [Hastlayer](https://hastlayer.com/), the .NET HLS tool.

Its goal is to implement an [Unum] (http://www.johngustafson.net/unums.html) proof of concept: the number type and an example using it, all transformable with Hastlayer.


## About Unum

Unum is a new number format invented by Dr. John L. Gustafson that can be used to store any number with exact precision (or known error). 

It can be used to achieve better range and accuracy than IEEE floating point formats while eliminating the algebraic errors that the IEEE floats are prone to.
